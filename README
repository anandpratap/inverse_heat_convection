## Observations - First

- Requires all the boundary points in the objective function to converge, which does not make sense because ideally boundary itself is not known.

- Without boundary points, it does not coverge to where it should.

- Sensitivity with the selection of objective function, it its limited to place near inlet, its more better (dependence on exponential)
